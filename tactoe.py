# TODO:
#
# 1. Currently the way to control the game is by 1-9, this should be changed to two sets of letters, one for each
#    player. Also the input should only take one character, as you currently have to confirm your selection by
#    hitting enter. This functionality has to be removed if the players are going to be able to play smoothy.
#  - Letters implemented but enter is still required. (we need https://pypi.python.org/pypi/getch) to be able to get that functionallity.
#
# 4. Kiko mentioned on todays meeting (19/9/2017) that displaying some help-text when pushin 'h' could be implemented. Now the text
#    is always displayed. The solution isn't as pretty, but maybe it'll work. Should be discussed at least?
